<div class='transcription'><h2>Transcription</h2><p>Temperature Fear-Free weight: 101.9 pounds. Mild erythema to the dorsal surface of the right front paw between digits 3 and 4. Mild erythema with a gummy substance on the ventral aspect of the right front paw. Carprofen to go home. Leptospirosis: one year. Right shoulder: SQ. Lyme: one year. Left shoulder: SQ. Return in March for examined vaccines. We viewed with the owner that I don&#x27;t see any evidence of trauma. There&#x27;s a little bit of gummy substance, which I suspect is sap under the bottom of his paw. We&#x27;d recommend that, because there is some inflammation going on, that we do an anti-inflammatory. The big key is going to be that he needs to leave it alone. The owner will work on preventing him from licking at it at home. Discuss also due for Lepto and Lyme. The owner approved doing Lepto and Lyme, and then the pet is due back in March.</p></div>
